## Quick CLI
While building and pushing an Ionic app to the play console, I thought I would consolidate the CLI commands for aligning and signing the apks. This assumes you already built the app and have a keystore.

##CLI Reference
To create the app: `dotnet new console`
To add the CLI package: `dotnet add package Microsoft.Extensions.CommandLineUtils`
